## About ##
This project is based on the baksmali-project which does a really good job disassembling dex-files to the smali-language.


## Goals ##
The goal of this project is to write a decompiler which produces 100% compilable java-sourcecode.

<b> I only want to make it possible to use code for studying or to recover your own code.<br />
The goal of this project will never be to support piracy or code-stealing!!! </b>
